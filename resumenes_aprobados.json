    "titulo": "Fed's Miran says he can't base policy stance on buoyant financial markets",
    "resumen": "The Federal Reserve is divided on the future course of monetary policy. Governor Stephen Miran argues that the current stance is too restrictive and risks causing a downturn, despite buoyant financial markets. He dissented in favor of a larger rate cut, stating that factors like housing market sluggishness and potential stress in parts of the financial system are being overlooked. In contrast, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, who dissented against the rate cut, believes the focus should remain on inflation, citing easy financial conditions. The debate is set to continue, with Fed officials expressing \"strongly differing views\" about the upcoming December meeting."

    "titulo": "US economy at risk of wobble as lower-income consumers get squeezed",
    "resumen": "The U.S. economy may face challenges in the coming weeks as lower-income consumers are squeezed by rising healthcare costs, potential loss of federal food benefits, and a shaky job market outlook. November, typically the start of the holiday shopping season, coincides with the possible loss of food benefits for many families due to the ongoing government shutdown and rising healthcare costs if ACA subsidies are cut. Despite low unemployment and consumer spending growth, policymakers lack updated government reports to understand how the economy is adapting. The loss of SNAP benefits and expiration of ACA tax credits could significantly impact household budgets. Economists don't necessarily see the economy tipping into recession, but the shutdown may lower growth for the fourth quarter. The Fed is closely watching the \"bifurcated\" pattern of higher-income families spending freely while others show signs of stress."

    "titulo": "China to ease chip export ban in new trade deal, White House says",
    "resumen": "The White House has announced a new trade deal between the US and China, which includes China easing its export ban on automotive computer chips crucial for global car production. The deal also covers agreements on US soybean exports, rare earth mineral supply, and materials used in fentanyl production. The trade war between the two nations had escalated after Trump imposed tariffs on China, leading to retaliatory measures and global business uncertainty. China will now take measures to resume trade from Nexperia's facilities, allowing the flow of critical legacy chips worldwide. However, the scope and conditions of the exemptions remain unclear, and supply shortages still loom due to the interruption. The deal also includes China pausing export controls on rare earth minerals for a year and taking significant measures to address the fentanyl issue."

    "titulo": "Euro zone manufacturing stagnates in October amid weak demand, PMI shows",
    "resumen": "The euro zone manufacturing sector stagnated in October, with the HCOB Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registering at 50.0, indicating neither growth nor contraction. Despite a marginal increase in output for the eighth consecutive month, new orders remained subdued, and export orders declined for the fourth month in a row. The reduction in headcount accelerated slightly, extending the sector's employment contraction to nearly two-and-a-half years. Performance varied across the region, with Greece and Spain showing improvements, while Germany and France remained in contraction territory. Manufacturers continued reducing inventory levels, and input costs remained unchanged from September. Business confidence about the year ahead declined for the second consecutive month due to persistent weak demand and economic uncertainty. (126 words)"
